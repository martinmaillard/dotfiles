# This script uses pip to display all the installed packages of the
# currently activated python (virtual)env that are not dependencies of
# other installed packages. It will supposedly make it easier to clean
# up a virtualenv without breaking stuff.
#
# Next step is to identify which of these packages are not used at all,
# but I'm not sure this can be done reliably.
